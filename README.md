# Haskell Concepts Repository

## Project Overview

This repository contains multiple Haskell programs demonstrating core **Haskell concepts** and functional programming principles. It is designed as a learning and practice project to explore Haskell’s **lists, tuples, dictionaries (associative lists), operators, type classes, and more**.  

Each file focuses on a specific topic, providing examples and exercises to reinforce understanding.

## Concepts Covered

- **Lists**
  - Creation, manipulation, and common operations
  - Higher-order functions (`map`, `filter`, `foldl`, `foldr`)
- **Tuples**
  - Creating and accessing tuples
  - Using tuples in functions and pattern matching
- **Dictionaries / Associative Lists**
  - Implementing key-value pairs
  - Lookup, insert, and update operations
- **Operators**
  - Arithmetic, logical, and custom operators
  - Operator precedence and associativity
- **Type Classes**
  - Instances of standard type classes (`Eq`, `Ord`, `Show`, `Num`)
  - Defining custom type class instances
- **Additional Topics**
  - Recursion and pattern matching
  - Functional composition
  - Input/output in Haskell
  - Error handling and Maybe/Either types
